- Parts of Angular component
  (Module(componnet(componentcclass,template,styles)))

** angular bootstrapping sequence
start -> index.html loads -> main.ts executes -> Root module loads -> rendered html displays web page



** understanding the flow across different angular files
*** step - 1 => compilation
- every angular app should contain atleast one module
- app.module.ts -> the class inthis is the root module which has information about
  1) all the components that are created
  2) any third party library or any angular specific library that is being used( you can see in the import section)

- any =component, directives and pipes= needs to be registered by declarations array

- this ng module in the app.module.ts has all the information about different components and different angular modules being used
  or any module created by you on your own that means you can have n number of modules in your application but you need one root module
  that will be created by angular once you start your angular application


So the control goes to the AppModule(in app.module.ts) which is the root module
this @NgModule is a decorator (it modifies the behaviour of your class) here it is giving all the meta data information about what modules and components
i am using to the compiler
here in bootstarpp we specify the root component (AppComponent here)
and this root component will be loaded in index.html

*** step - 2 => boostrapping
Now that the compilation has done angular needs to know which component it needs to load first
**** what is component?
from app.module.ts control goes to the app.component.ts along with for component 3 more files are created
- .ts
- .spec.ts
- .scss
- .html

Similar to root module we will have root component   
properties of @component({
---
})

selector: 'app-root' => becomes html tag
you can do in two ways of writing html in angular
templateUrl: 'app.component.html' => for sepearte html file
template: => you can use this property when you want to write innline html
e.g:- template: '<h1>hello world from inline templated</h1>'

TIP :- install extension can angular-language-service for language intelicense

- for multi line you can use ``
  template : `<h1>
this is multilie </h1>`

styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],
styles: [`h1 {color: red;}`]


- creating prefix when creating the app => ng new <application name> --prefix <prefixname>

  
- runninng the server using -> ng serve -o
- ng g c <component name>(rooms comp in this case)
- for angular commands visit angular docs > side bar > references > cli command references===-09
- add the html tag of rooms component in the root component(app.component.html in this case)


**** binding information
there are 3 ways to bind information that is available in ts file to the html file
1. Interpolation
2. property binding
3. Event binding

=1.Interpolation=
using interpolation you can bind dates,string,number,objects using interpolation

say you have defined a name of type string in your comp class and you want to display in your .html file corresponding to comp
export class Roomscomponent  implements OnInit {
hotelname="hilton hotel"
constructor(){}
OnInit():void{

}
}

in the html file=====>
<h1>welcome to {{hotelname}}</h1>

=2.property binding=
angular allows us to use native html properties for binding
say we have noOfrooms property declared with value 10 in the class

one way of accessing this in this binding is
<div [innerText]="noOfrooms"></div> // this is similar to below
document.getElementByID('noOfrooms').innerText=noOfrooms


=3.event binding=
<button onClick="handleClick()"></button>  // this way is used in js

.ts
hiderooms=false
toggle(){
this.hiderooms=!this.hiderooms
}
.html
<div [hidden]="hiderooms">

// some html
</div>
<button (click)="toggle()"></button>



** debugging the angular application
open  devtools > sources > page(leftmost) > webpack > . folder(it contains your src)
here you can add break points by clicking the line numbers
you can do c-p and open any file


** Directives in angular
they are something that can change the behaviour or appearences of your dom element
- directives can implement all lifecycle hooks
- diff b/w directive and component is directives cannot have templates

*** types of directives
1. structural directives (they are always costlier they are going to change the behaviour of the dom which may give performance issue)
2. attribute directive (mostly u use this directive)

**** built-in directives
- *ngIf
  TIP: use nfIf as much as possible don't reply on the hidden attribute of the tag to hide the eleement
  because although the tag is not visible in the ui but it is visible in the devtools
  EG:-
  <div *ngIf="rooms.availableRooms > 0">
  rooms list 
</div>

***** nullish collision and optional chaining
{{ rooms?.availableRooms ?? 'noofrooms'}}  // this is nullish collision
// this above takes care of two things if rooms available it will print it  else print noofrooms

<div *ngIf="rooms?.available"> // optional chaining
rooms list 
</div>

- *ngFor
<div *ngIf="rooms?.available"> // optional chaining
Rooms list
<table>
<tr>
<th>eve/odd</th>
<th>room number</th>
<th>room type</th>
<th>room price</th>
<th>room ameneties</th>
</tr>
<tr *ngFor="let room of roomList; let e=even; let o=odd; let i=index"> //i starts from 0
<td>{{ e? "even" : "odd"}}</td>
<td>{{ room.roomnummber }}</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
  

- structural directives are the ones which add or remove the element from the dom
- ngClass and ngStyle are attribute based built in directives


.scss 
.even{
background-color: stealblue;
color:white;
}
.odd{
background-color:tomato;
color:white;
}

//let see who we can use class to toggle between even and odd
.html
<tr
  [ngClass]="e? 'even' : 'odd'"
  *ngFor = " let room of ".....
  
></tr>


<div [ngStyle]="{'color':rooms.availableRooms ? 'green' : 'red'}"
[innerText]="numberOfRomms"
>
