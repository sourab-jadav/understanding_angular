- Parts of Angular component
  (Module(componnet(componentcclass,template,styles)))

** angular bootstrapping sequence
start -> index.html loads -> main.ts executes -> Root module loads -> rendered html displays web page



** understanding the flow across different angular files
*** step - 1 => compilation
- every angular app should contain atleast one module
- app.module.ts -> the class inthis is the root module which has information about
  1) all the components that are created
  2) any third party library or any angular specific library that is being used( you can see in the import section)

- any =component, directives and pipes= needs to be registered by declarations array

- this ng module in the app.module.ts has all the information about different components and different angular modules being used
  or any module created by you on your own that means you can have n number of modules in your application but you need one root module
  that will be created by angular once you start your angular application


So the control goes to the AppModule(in app.module.ts) which is the root module
this @NgModule is a decorator (it modifies the behaviour of your class) here it is giving all the meta data information about what modules and components
i am using to the compiler
here in bootstarpp we specify the root component (AppComponent here)
and this root component will be loaded in index.html

*** step - 2 => boostrapping
Now that the compilation has done angular needs to know which component it needs to load first
**** what is component?
from app.module.ts control goes to the app.component.ts along with for component 3 more files are created
- .ts
- .spec.ts
- .scss
- .html

Similar to root module we will have root component   
properties of @component({
---
})

selector: 'app-root' => becomes html tag
you can do in two ways of writing html in angular
templateUrl: 'app.component.html' => for sepearte html file
template: => you can use this property when you want to write innline html
e.g:- template: '<h1>hello world from inline templated</h1>'

TIP :- install extension can angular-language-service for language intelicense

- for multi line you can use ``
  template : `<h1>
this is multilie </h1>`

styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],
styles: [`h1 {color: red;}`]


- creating prefix when creating the app => ng new <application name> --prefix <prefixname>

  
- runninng the server using -> ng serve -o
- ng g c <component name>(rooms comp in this case)
- for angular commands visit angular docs > side bar > references > cli command references===-09
- add the html tag of rooms component in the root component(app.component.html in this case)
